# RecipeBoxV2

## Added favorites and edit recipe option to Jake's Recipebox.

### as little refactoring as possible. Didn't recieve any help from the original owner.

### Instructions:
  - Start a virtual environment with pipenv:
      `pipenv shell`
  - install Django in your virtual environment:
      `pipenv install django`
  - Be sure to make your migrations, and migrate, make sure your environment is activated:
      `pipenv shell`
      `python manage.py makemigrations`
      `python manage.py migrate`
  - Now you can run the application like so:
      `python manage.py runserver`
  
  - Enjoy Recipebox!
